# CODEOWNERS - Define code ownership for automated review requests
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order matters - later patterns override earlier ones.
# Owners can be @usernames, @org/team-names, or email addresses.

# Default owners for everything in the repo
# Uncomment and customize:
# * @your-username

# Examples by file type:
# *.js @frontend-team
# *.py @backend-team
# *.go @backend-team

# Examples by directory:
# /src/ @dev-team
# /docs/ @docs-team
# /.github/ @devops-team

# Protect sensitive files:
# /security/ @security-team
# *.env.example @security-team

# Require specific reviewers for CI/CD:
# /.github/workflows/ @devops-team @security-team
# Dockerfile @devops-team
# docker-compose*.yml @devops-team
