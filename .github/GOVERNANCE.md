# Project Governance

This document describes how the GitHub Repository Setup Guide project is governed.

## Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers have full access to the repository and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases
- Triaging issues
- Enforcing the code of conduct
- Making architectural decisions

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes to the project through:

- Code contributions
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports
- Feature suggestions
- Community support

## Decision Making

### Minor Decisions

For small changes (bug fixes, documentation, minor features):

- A single maintainer approval is sufficient
- Changes can be merged after CI passes

### Major Decisions

For significant changes (new features, breaking changes, architecture):

1. Open an issue for discussion
2. Allow community input (minimum 3 days)
3. Maintainers discuss and reach consensus
4. Document the decision in the issue

### Conflict Resolution

If maintainers disagree:

1. Discuss in the relevant issue or PR
2. Seek input from other maintainers
3. If no consensus, the primary maintainer decides
4. Document the rationale

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors may be invited to become maintainers based on:

- Consistent, quality contributions over time
- Understanding of project goals and patterns
- Constructive participation in discussions
- Reliability and responsiveness

Process:

1. Existing maintainer nominates contributor
2. Other maintainers review and approve
3. Invitation extended
4. Access granted upon acceptance

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

Maintainers are responsible for enforcing the code of conduct:

1. Warning for first minor violation
2. Temporary ban for repeated or moderate violations
3. Permanent ban for severe violations

All enforcement actions are documented privately.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this document require:

- A pull request with proposed changes
- Discussion period of at least 7 days
- Approval from majority of maintainers

## Contact

For governance questions, open an issue or contact the maintainers directly.
